# New_Layers (Keras-Tensorflow)

In this repository, I will continue adding new layers from recent papers, 
they are tested on Keras-1.2.2.  

The layers include:

# Spatial Transformer Networks (STN).

[1] Spatial Transformer Networks. 

https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025

# Spatial Warping Layer. 

This is based on the STN, instead of using transformation matrices to transform, this layer uses the x,y displacements.

# Separable RNN Layer.

Seperate the RNN into two parts, convolution + recurrence.
This layer can accept input directly from linear convolution.
